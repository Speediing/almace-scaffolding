PetPal is A Hackathon project that three others and I made to help optimize pet care for children. The app is essentially a game that helps children take care of their pets by treating the tasks they need to do as a game. By gamifying the pet ownership, the child is incentivized to routinely take care of their animalâ€™s basic needs every day.

When the child initially opens the app, they are given an onboarding that includes naming the animal and the basic mechanics of the game. Here they are told that they need to log into the app every day to log that they pet/walked/fed the animal. To log the details the child only must tap on the little floating clouds and it brings the health bar up. If the child completes all the tasks for the day their animal gets to level up. Now if the child forgets to do all the tasks on a given day the animal is reset to level 0. This mechanic can be related to snapchat streak. The child can see how close they are to having the level reset by looking at the health bar on the right of the screen. This bar depletes as a function of time and goes back up if one of the tasks is completed. There is also a settings menu where you can change the animals name and change the frequency at which the tasks needed to be done.

While the app itself is very simplistic there were many roadblocks that we encountered on our way along. The biggest of which being the time limit of 24 hours to complete the entire project. The meant we really needed to prioritize what we needed and what we did not. The primary thing we wanted was to get the basic mechanics in as well as prioritizing the look and feel of the app. We had goals attached to time markers to help keep us on pace as well as well as to help us monitor what work was getting done by who.

Another challenge that we had was the lack of experience of our group. I was the only one on the group who had any iOS experience and even then, I had only learned it a couple months prior. I had to teach everyone on the group the basics of XCode and Swift to get them up and running. I also had to decide what to teach them to help them best execute the tasks that I wanted done for the app. For example, I had taught one person the basics of animating views and had him do a big chunk of that work. Another person had Photoshop experience so he was the one who worked on a lot of the assets for the app and the design. I focused on a lot of the mechanics and code of the app because that would be the hardest to teach in such a short period of time.

As I mentioned before a big focus was to make the app as visually appealing as possible because our main user demographic was children. To achieve this, we handmade all the assets with a specific style in mind. This shows in the consistency of the look. I also made a focus in animating as much as possible to help make the experience more live and reactive. 

The short time period made us limit a lot of the scope of the app but we had a lot larger of a vision for the app. One thing we would have added if we had more time would be the ability to have user accounts to track the user interactions and give achievements for certain events (ex. A level 100 dog). Currently the app is local only with no internet interactions. Another feature that we thought would be useful would be to be able to change which tasks needed to be done. Say for example your dog needed a specific medicine every day, you could add it into the app and help remember to administer it. Of course, the sky is the limit and we could spend months building out features but the Hackathon really taught us what to prioritize and what not to.

The Hackathon was a really great experience because I learned a lot about teamwork and project management as well as getting to refine some of my programming skills. Not to mention all the free food they gave us. The app is currently open source on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Speediing/petPal) and we have no plans to submit it for app store approvals.
